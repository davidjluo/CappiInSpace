# CappiInSpace
A 2D mobile-friendly puzzle game geared towards casual gamers. Developed in Unity with C#.

The NASA CAPSat project has launched into space, and it's YOUR job to help program Cappi and guide him through his missions. 
Drag and drop different tokens onto the gameboard to manuever through space and pick up valuable data. Avoid obstacles, and use various
powerups to keep Cappi healthy and exploring!

The project is ONGOING. Stay tuned for updates.
